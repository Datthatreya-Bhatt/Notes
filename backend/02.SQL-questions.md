#### What is SQL and NoSQL ?

* **SQL**: A type of database that uses structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. It's relational, with data stored in tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

* **NoSQL**: A type of database that doesn't use SQL as its main query language. It's non-relational, often used for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).




#### What is procedure and functions in postgres ?
**In PostgreSQL:**

### **Function:**

* Returns a value.
* Can be used in SQL queries.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name(param1 type, param2 type)
RETURNS return_type AS $$
BEGIN
  -- function logic
  RETURN value;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

---

### **Procedure:**

* Does **not** return a value.
* Used for performing actions like insert/update.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(param1 type, param2 type)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- procedure logic
END;
$$;
```

#### Show one simple example for postgres transactions
Here's a simple example of how to use **transactions** in PostgreSQL:

### **PostgreSQL Transaction Example:**

```sql
BEGIN;  -- Start the transaction

-- Perform some database operations
INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES ('Alice', 'Developer');
UPDATE employees SET position = 'Senior Developer' WHERE name = 'Bob';

-- If everything is fine, commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

### **Rollback Example (if something goes wrong):**

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Perform operations
INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES ('Charlie', 'Manager');

-- Simulating an error (e.g., some condition fails)
-- If you have a condition to check, you can ROLLBACK here if needed
ROLLBACK;  -- This will undo all changes made in the transaction
```

### **Explanation:**

* **BEGIN;** starts the transaction.
* **COMMIT;** saves all changes if everything is successful.
* **ROLLBACK;** undoes the changes if there’s an error or you want to cancel the transaction.

---

#### When should we use SQL and NoSQL
* **Use SQL** when you need structured data with relationships (tables, foreign keys), ACID compliance (for transactions), and complex queries (joins, aggregations). Examples: banking systems, inventory management.

* **Use NoSQL** when you need flexible, scalable storage for unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores. Great for high-volume, distributed, or rapidly changing data. Examples: social media, real-time analytics.

---

#### What is difference between truncate and delete in sql?
* **DELETE**:

  * Removes rows one by one.
  * Can have a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to delete.
  * Slower for large datasets.
  * Can be rolled back (transactional).

* **TRUNCATE**:

  * Removes all rows in a table at once.
  * Cannot use a `WHERE` clause.
  * Faster for large datasets.
  * Cannot be rolled back (in most cases, it’s not transactional).


#### What is indexing and What are the different type of indexing and How to create it ?
### **Indexing**:

* It's a way to improve the speed of data retrieval from a database by creating a data structure (index) that allows for faster searches.

### **Types of Indexing**:

1. **B-tree Index** (default in most DBs): Efficient for equality and range queries.
2. **Hash Index**: Fast for exact match lookups.
3. **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)**: Used for complex data types (e.g., geometric data).
4. **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**: Useful for full-text search and array data types.
5. **BRIN (Block Range INdex)**: Efficient for large tables with sorted or sequential data.

### **How to Create an Index**:

```sql
-- Create a simple B-tree index (default)
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

-- Create a unique index (ensures no duplicate values)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```
---

#### What is the advantage and disadvantage of indexing.
### **Advantages of Indexing**:

1. **Faster Query Performance**: Speeds up data retrieval, especially for large tables.
2. **Efficient Search**: Optimizes SELECT queries with WHERE clauses and JOINs.
3. **Improved Sorting**: Makes ORDER BY operations faster.

### **Disadvantages of Indexing**:

1. **Slower Write Operations**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE become slower because indexes need to be updated.
2. **Increased Storage**: Indexes take up additional disk space.
3. **Complexity**: Managing indexes (choosing the right ones) can be complex and requires tuning.
---

#### What are views and triggers And How to create it, why we need views and triggers?
### **Views**:

* **Definition**: A virtual table based on the result of a query. It doesn’t store data but provides a simplified way to access data.

* **Why We Need Views**:

  * Simplifies complex queries.
  * Can hide sensitive data by exposing only specific columns.
  * Allows reusable queries.

* **How to Create a View**:

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

---

### **Triggers**:

* **Definition**: A set of actions automatically executed in response to certain events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table.

* **Why We Need Triggers**:

  * Enforce data integrity (e.g., automatically updating related tables).
  * Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., logging).

* **How to Create a Trigger**:

  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
  BEFORE INSERT ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION function_name();
  ```
---

#### WHat are joins ? What are the different types of Joins ?
### **Joins**:

* **Definition**: A way to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

### **Types of Joins**:

1. **INNER JOIN**:

   * Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
     ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**:

   * Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1
     LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
     ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**:

   * Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1
     RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
     ```

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**:

   * Returns all rows when there’s a match in either left or right table. NULLs are returned where there’s no match.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1
     FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
     ```

5. **CROSS JOIN**:

   * Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every row of the first table combined with every row of the second table).
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1
     CROSS JOIN table2;
     ```

6. **SELF JOIN**:

   * A join where a table is joined with itself.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT a.name, b.name
     FROM employees a, employees b
     WHERE a.manager_id = b.id;
     ```
---


#### Write query showing different kinds of joins.
Same as previous answer

#### What is sharding in SQL ?
**Sharding** in SQL is a method of distributing data across multiple databases or servers (called **shards**) to improve scalability and performance. Each shard holds a subset of the data, allowing for better load balancing and faster queries by dividing the dataset into smaller, more manageable parts.

### **Why Use Sharding?**

* **Scalability**: Helps handle large datasets by splitting them across multiple servers.
* **Performance**: Reduces the load on a single server, improving response times.

### **Example**:

* A large user database can be divided (sharded) based on user regions, with different servers holding data for different geographic areas.


#### What is BLOB in SQL ?
**BLOB** (Binary Large Object) in SQL is a data type used to store large amounts of binary data, such as images, audio, video, or any other type of multimedia content.

### **Key Points**:

* **Storage**: Used for storing large files or unstructured data.
* **Size**: Can store very large data, typically in the range of gigabytes.
* **Usage**: Commonly used for storing files like pictures, documents, or other binary data.

### **Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  file_data BLOB
);
```



#### What are constraints, explain any 5 of them.
**Constraints** in SQL are rules that are applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.

### **Five Common Constraints**:

1. **PRIMARY KEY**:

   * Ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier.
   * Cannot have `NULL` values.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
       user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100)
     );
     ```

2. **FOREIGN KEY**:

   * Ensures that a column's value matches a value in another table's column (to maintain referential integrity).
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
     );
     ```

3. **UNIQUE**:

   * Ensures that all values in a column are unique (no duplicates), but allows `NULL` values.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id INT UNIQUE,
       product_name VARCHAR(100)
     );
     ```

4. **NOT NULL**:

   * Ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );
     ```

5. **CHECK**:

   * Ensures that the values in a column meet a specific condition or constraint.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE students (
       student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
     );
     ```

These constraints help maintain data quality and consistency within the database.



#### What is UNIQUE constraints ?
The **UNIQUE constraint** in SQL ensures that all values in a column are distinct (no duplicates), but it allows `NULL` values.

### **Key Points**:

* It guarantees that each value in the column is unique.
* Unlike **PRIMARY KEY**, it allows multiple `NULL` values.
* Can be applied to one or more columns.

### **Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

In this example, the `email` column must have unique values for every row.



#### What are primary keys and foreign keys.When to use what ? Explain with an example.
### **Primary Key**:

* A **Primary Key** is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
* It **cannot** have `NULL` values, and each value must be unique.

### **Foreign Key**:

* A **Foreign Key** is a column (or combination of columns) that establishes a link between the data in two tables.
* It points to the **Primary Key** of another table to enforce referential integrity.

---

### **When to Use**:

* **Use Primary Key** when you need to uniquely identify each record in a table (e.g., an ID for users, products, etc.).
* **Use Foreign Key** when you want to link data in one table to data in another table (e.g., linking orders to users).

---

### **Example**:

```sql
-- Create users table with a primary key
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create orders table with a foreign key referring to users table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

In this example:

* `user_id` in the **users** table is a **Primary Key**, ensuring each user is uniquely identified.
* `user_id` in the **orders** table is a **Foreign Key**, linking each order to a specific user.


#### What is the difference between primary key and unique key?
### **Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key**:

1. **Uniqueness**:

   * **Primary Key**: Ensures that each row in the table has a unique value. No duplicates are allowed.
   * **Unique Key**: Also ensures that all values in the column are unique, but allows `NULL` values.

2. **NULL Values**:

   * **Primary Key**: Cannot have `NULL` values.
   * **Unique Key**: Can have one `NULL` value (depends on the database system).

3. **Number of Keys**:

   * **Primary Key**: Only one primary key can exist per table.
   * **Unique Key**: You can have multiple unique keys in a table.

4. **Purpose**:

   * **Primary Key**: Defines the unique identifier for a record in a table.
   * **Unique Key**: Enforces uniqueness for a column, but doesn’t necessarily serve as the record identifier.

### **Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Primary key
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE  -- Unique key
);
```

In this example:

* `user_id` is the **Primary Key**, ensuring every user has a unique ID.
* `email` is the **Unique Key**, ensuring no two users have the same email, but it can have one `NULL` value if the email is not provided.


#### What is a subquery? What are its various types?
### **Subquery**:

* A **subquery** is a query embedded inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be used by the outer query.
* It can be placed in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.

---

### **Types of Subqueries**:

1. **Single-row Subquery**:

   * Returns a single value (one row and one column).
   * Used with comparison operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, etc.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT name 
     FROM employees 
     WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
     ```

2. **Multiple-row Subquery**:

   * Returns multiple rows and can be used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL`.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT name 
     FROM employees 
     WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');
     ```

3. **Correlated Subquery**:

   * A subquery that refers to columns from the outer query. It runs once for each row processed by the outer query.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT name 
     FROM employees e 
     WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
     ```

4. **Scalar Subquery**:

   * Returns a single value (one row and one column), typically used where an expression is expected (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`).
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE user_id = users.id) AS order_count
     FROM users;
     ```

---

### **Summary**:

* Subqueries allow you to perform complex queries by nesting one query inside another.
* They can return single or multiple rows and can be correlated with the outer query.
---

#### What is the use of UNION keyword in SQL? Write an example query.
### **Use of UNION in SQL**:

* The **UNION** keyword is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set.
* It removes duplicate rows by default (to include duplicates, you can use **UNION ALL**).
* The columns in all `SELECT` statements must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.

---

### **Example**:

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```

In this example:

* The query combines the names from both the **employees** and **contractors** tables into a single list.
* Duplicate names will be removed by default. If you want to include duplicates, you would use `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`.
---


#### What are Entities and Relationship (ER)?
### **Entities**:

* **Definition**: An **entity** is any object, person, place, or thing in the real world that can be identified and has data stored about it in a database.
* **Example**: In a school database, **Student** and **Course** can be entities.

### **Relationships**:

* **Definition**: A **relationship** describes how entities are related to each other.
* **Example**: A **Student** may enroll in a **Course**, creating a relationship between the **Student** and **Course** entities.

---

### **ER (Entity-Relationship) Model**:

* The **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** is a diagram used to visually represent the structure of a database. It shows entities, their attributes, and the relationships between entities.

### **Example**:

* **Entities**: `Student`, `Course`
* **Relationship**: `Enrolled in` (a Student can enroll in multiple Courses)
---

#### What are the different types of relationships between tables, which are there?
### **Types of Relationships Between Tables**:

1. **One-to-One (1:1)**:

   * Each row in Table A is related to exactly one row in Table B, and vice versa.
   * Example: A **Person** can have only one **Passport**.

2. **One-to-Many (1\:N)**:

   * One row in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B, but each row in Table B is related to only one row in Table A.
   * Example: A **Department** can have many **Employees**, but each **Employee** belongs to one **Department**.

3. **Many-to-Many (N\:M)**:

   * Many rows in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B, and vice versa.
   * This relationship is typically implemented using a **junction table** (a third table).
   * Example: **Students** can enroll in many **Courses**, and each **Course** can have many **Students**.
---




#### What is the difference between truncate, delete, drop?
### **Difference Between TRUNCATE, DELETE, and DROP**:

1. **TRUNCATE**:

   * Removes **all rows** from a table quickly.
   * **Cannot** be rolled back in most databases (non-transactional).
   * **Does not** log individual row deletions.
   * **Does not** remove the table structure (you can still insert data into the table).

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
   ```

2. **DELETE**:

   * Removes rows based on a condition (with `WHERE` clause).
   * **Can** be rolled back (transactional).
   * Logs each row deletion.
   * The table structure remains, and you can still insert data into it.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   ```

3. **DROP**:

   * Completely removes the **entire table** (structure and data) from the database.
   * **Cannot** be rolled back.
   * Frees up the storage space used by the table.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE table_name;
   ```



#### If we drop table what else will be deleted with it.
When you **DROP** a table, the following will also be deleted:

1. **Table Structure**: The table itself (including its columns, constraints, etc.) is permanently removed.
2. **Data**: All rows of data stored in the table are deleted.
3. **Indexes**: Any indexes associated with the table are also deleted.
4. **Constraints**: Any constraints (like primary keys, foreign keys) defined on the table are removed.
5. **Triggers**: Triggers associated with the table are deleted.

Basically, a **DROP** completely removes the table and all related objects from the database.


#### What is the difference between IN and BETWEEN?
### **Difference Between IN and BETWEEN**:

1. **IN**:

   * Used to check if a value matches any value in a list or a subquery.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);
     ```

     This checks if `department_id` is either 1, 2, or 3.

2. **BETWEEN**:

   * Used to check if a value is within a **range** (inclusive of the boundary values).
   * Example:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000;
     ```

     This checks if `salary` is between 30,000 and 50,000, inclusive.

### **Key Difference**:

* **IN** is used for discrete values, while **BETWEEN** is used for a range of values.




#### What is the ACID property in a database? Explain each one of them.
### **ACID Properties in a Database**:

ACID stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,** and **Durability**. These properties ensure reliable and secure database transactions.

1. **Atomicity**:

   * **Definition**: A transaction is treated as a single unit, which means it either completes fully or doesn’t happen at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.
   * **Example**: Transferring money between two bank accounts. Either the full amount is transferred, or nothing happens.

2. **Consistency**:

   * **Definition**: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It ensures that any transaction will only bring the database to a consistent state, following all rules and constraints (e.g., integrity constraints).
   * **Example**: If a transaction tries to violate a database constraint (like adding a duplicate primary key), it will fail.

3. **Isolation**:

   * **Definition**: Transactions are executed independently and transparently. Even if multiple transactions are happening at the same time, they don’t affect each other.
   * **Example**: One transaction should not see the intermediate results of another transaction that hasn't yet been committed.

4. **Durability**:

   * **Definition**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and will survive even if the system crashes.
   * **Example**: After transferring money, the update will persist even if there is a power failure immediately after the transaction is completed.

These ACID properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably and securely.



#### What is a deadlock in SQL?
### **Deadlock in SQL**:

* A **deadlock** occurs when two or more database transactions are waiting for each other to release resources (like locks), and none of the transactions can proceed.
* It results in a situation where the transactions are stuck, and none can finish, causing a standstill.

### **Example**:

* **Transaction A** locks **Resource 1** and waits for **Resource 2**.
* **Transaction B** locks **Resource 2** and waits for **Resource 1**.
* Both transactions are now waiting for each other, causing a deadlock.

### **Solution**:

* The database management system (DBMS) typically detects deadlocks and **automatically resolves** them by rolling back one of the transactions to break the deadlock.



#### Is a blank space or zero the same as a NULL value?
No, a **blank space** (empty string) and **zero** are **not** the same as a **NULL** value in SQL.

### **Differences**:

* **NULL**: Represents the absence of a value. It means "unknown" or "missing" data.
* **Blank Space** (empty string): It's a string with zero characters, but it's still considered a valid value, not NULL.
* **Zero (0)**: It's a numeric value, not NULL, and represents a valid number.

### Example:

* `NULL` means no value at all.
* A blank space `''` is a valid, empty string.
* `0` is a number, not NULL, and has a specific meaning.



#### What is the usage of the NVL() function?
The **NVL()** function in SQL is used to replace **NULL** values with a specified value.

### **Usage**:

* If the given expression is **NULL**, the function returns the specified replacement value.
* If the expression is **not NULL**, it returns the original value.

### **Syntax**:

```sql
NVL(expression, replacement_value)
```

### **Example**:

```sql
SELECT NVL(salary, 0) FROM employees;
```

* In this example, if `salary` is `NULL`, it will be replaced with `0`. Otherwise, the actual salary value will be shown.

### **Common Use**:

* It is commonly used to handle **NULL** values and avoid errors in calculations or results.



#### What is SQL Injection?
**SQL Injection** is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can insert or manipulate SQL queries in a web application's input fields. This happens when the application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input.

### **How it works**:

* An attacker can input malicious SQL code into a form field (like a login form or search box).
* If the input is not properly sanitized, the SQL code gets executed, potentially giving the attacker unauthorized access to the database or allowing them to modify data.

### **Example**:

* A vulnerable login form might use the following SQL query:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password';
  ```
* An attacker could input this into the username or password field:

  ```sql
  ' OR '1'='1
  ```

  This could change the query to:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';
  ```

  This condition always evaluates to true, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.

### **Preventing SQL Injection**:

* Use **prepared statements** or **parameterized queries**.
* Validate and sanitize user inputs.
* Use stored procedures where appropriate.



#### What is BLOB and TEXT in MySQL?
### **BLOB (Binary Large Object)**:

* **Definition**: A data type used to store large amounts of binary data, such as images, audio, video, or other multimedia content.
* **Storage**: Stores data in binary format.
* **Size**: Can store up to 65,535 bytes of data (depends on the type of BLOB).

### **TEXT**:

* **Definition**: A data type used to store large amounts of text data.
* **Storage**: Stores data as plain text (characters).
* **Size**: Can store up to 65,535 characters of text.

### **Key Difference**:

* **BLOB** is used for binary data (like files), while **TEXT** is used for storing plain text data.

### **Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE media_files (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  image BLOB,
  description TEXT
);
```

* In this example, `image` stores binary data (e.g., an image file), while `description` stores text data (e.g., a caption).



#### In SQL what is primary key and foreign key?
### **Primary Key**:

* A **Primary Key** is a column (or a set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.
* It **cannot** have `NULL` values and must contain unique values for every row.
* There can only **one** primary key in a table.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Here, `emp_id` is the **Primary Key** that uniquely identifies each employee.

---

### **Foreign Key**:

* A **Foreign Key** is a column (or set of columns) in a table that establishes a link between the data in two tables.
* It references the **Primary Key** of another table to maintain referential integrity between the two tables.
* It can contain `NULL` values and does not need to be unique.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id)
);
```

Here, `emp_id` in the **orders** table is a **Foreign Key** that references the `emp_id` in the **employees** table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables.



#### what are transactions and what is its uses?
### **Transactions**:

A **transaction** in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations (such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.) that are executed as a single unit. Transactions are used to manage changes made to the database, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

### **Uses of Transactions**:

1. **Atomicity**:

   * Ensures that all operations in a transaction are either fully completed or fully rolled back (no partial operations).

2. **Consistency**:

   * Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, following all integrity constraints.

3. **Isolation**:

   * Ensures that transactions are executed independently, and the operations of one transaction do not affect others.

4. **Durability**:

   * Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.

### **Example**:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

In this example, money is transferred from one account to another. If both operations are successful, the changes are committed, otherwise, if there’s an error, the changes can be rolled back to keep the data consistent.




#### How to delete a column in SQL? Please write the query.
To **delete a column** in SQL, you use the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `DROP COLUMN` clause.

### **Syntax**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

### **Example**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
